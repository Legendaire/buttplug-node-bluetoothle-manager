Module for adding Bluetooth LE device capabilities to native Buttplug
Node Servers (using
[buttplug-js](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-js)). Uses the
[Noble package](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/noble) for accessing
native Bluetooth LE APIs.

## IMPORTANT BUILD NOTE

**DO NOT USE YARN TO INSTALL THIS**

Installing with yarn will break the native dependencies required for
this package. Only use 'npm install' to install this. Afterwards,
using yarn is fine.

## Installation

To install buttplug-js in your node project via npm, a simple add call
should do it.

```
npm add buttplug-node-bluetoothle-manager
```

buttplug-node-bluetoothle-manager is considered a plugin for
buttplug-js, and has that project as a peer dependency. You will need
to add buttplug-js >= 0.4.0 to the project that is using
buttplug-node-bluetoothle-manager in order for this to work correctly.

## API Documentation

buttplug-node-bluetoothle-manager API Documentation is available at
[https://buttplug-node-bluetoothle-manager.docs.buttplug.io](https://buttplug-node-bluetoothle-manager.docs.buttplug.io).

The documentation is rebuilt on every commit/merge to master.

## Usage Example

This module provides a DeviceManager derived class that can be added
to a Buttplug server. Not that this manager will not work with
browser-based projects, it is only meant for native node projects.
Browser-based projects can use the WebBluetooth manager that comes
as part of buttplug-js.

To add a new BluetoothLE manager:

```javascript
let Buttplug = require('buttplug');
let ButtplugBLEManager = require('buttplug-bluetoothle-manager');
let bs = new Buttplug.ButtplugServer();
bs.AddDeviceManager(new ButtplugBLEManager.ButtplugBluetoothLEDeviceManager());
// ...
```

After the manager has been added, if the server receives a
StartScanning request and has a bluetooth radio that is connected and
on, it will scan for bluetooth devices. The server can find all
devices supported by the version of buttplug-js in your project. See
the [buttplug-js
README](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-js#readme) for a list
of supported devices.
